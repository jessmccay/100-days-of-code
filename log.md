### Day 2: April 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I mob programmed on a Ruby on Rails application. We worked on customizing the devise sign up fields!. We struggled for a little while as the custom fields were not showing up. We worked through it and by the end of our work session we amade it happen! 4 hours spent on this today!

**Thoughts** I am so excited to be back working with rails, especially on this project in paticular. Mob programming was fantastic. Working with two other minds made our work flow so much more powerful. Also, we our thinking about doing a documentation on this to help our fellow developers!
