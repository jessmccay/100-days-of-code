# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed 10 hours worth of work in CSS and Bootstrap!

**Thoughts** I feel good about this start to my 100 days of Code challenge. I learned a few extra things that I did not previously know about!

### Day 2: April 6, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I mob programmed on a Ruby on Rails application. We worked on customizing the devise sign up fields!. We struggled for a little while as the custom fields were not showing up. We worked through it and by the end of our work session we amade it happen! 4 hours spent on this today!

**Thoughts** I am so excited to be back working with rails, especially on this project in paticular. Mob programming was fantastic. Working with two other minds made our work flow so much more powerful. Also, we our thinking about doing a documentation on this to help our fellow developers!

### Day 3: April 7, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today was about TESTING! Again, I mob programmed with my team on our personal app. We tested the code that we wrote yesterday for the additional fields for the devise form. Also we added the same fields to our edit form. Additionally, we were able to add a task feature and of course test it. 

**Thoughts** Testing is very important to ensure good code. I am pleased that we are not counting any story as finished until tested and passing. Note: when testing devise field for email make sure to include the @, otherwise, the test fails and the user does not get saved into the database.

### Day 4: April 8, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I refreshed myself on some basic javascript. Something I learned was that if you are inside a function and declare a variable without 'var', it automatically becomes part of the global scope, which can cause problems! 

**Thoughts** I felt pretty strong on most I went over today. I am glad I did it becasue there were a couple of new things I was intoduced to and on top of that I just feel that much more confident.

### Day 5: April 9, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing practicing javascript. Todays focus was on comparison operators , if / if else statements. I worked for a little over an hour.

**Thoughts** Overall this was review, Although there is something quite important that I learned today. I previously wasnt really sure what the difference was or if there even was a difference between == and === . Now I know that YES, there is a difference. For example if I was to compare 5 == "5" , this would return true. Now if I compared the same  5 === "5" this would return false. The == converts one of the two data types so that they are the same while the 'strict' === does not convert.

### Day 6: April 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Mob programmed Ruby on Rails App. This included making buttons, creating categories for tasks, creating seed data and feature testing. Later today I will be practicing more javascript.

**Thoughts** I feel great. I am more than excited to be making progress on this rails app. We learned about to seed data! Very exciting and useful!
